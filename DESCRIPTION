Description: Provide a high-performance, flexible and extensible framework to
develop continuous-time agent based models. Its high performance
allows it to simulate millions of agents efficiently. Agents are defined by
their states (arbitrary R lists). The events are handled in chronological
order. This avoids the multi-event interaction problem in a time step of
discrete-time simulations, and gives precise outcomes. The states are modified
by provided or user-defined events. The framework provides a flexible
and customizable implementation of state transitions (either spontaneous or
caused by agent interactions), making the framework suitable to apply to
epidemiology and ecology, e.g., to model life history stages, competition and
cooperation, disease and information spread. The agent interactions are
flexible and extensible. The framework provides random mixing and network
interactions, and supports multi-level mixing patterns. It can be easily
extended to other interactions such as inter- and intra-households (or
workplaces or schools) by subclassing an R6 class. It can be used to study
the effect of age-specific, group-specific, and contact-specific intervention
strategies, and complex interactions between individual behavior and
population dynamics. This modeling concept can also be used in business,
economical and political models. As a generic event based framework, it can
be applied to many other fields. More information about the implementation
and examples can be found at <https://github.com/junlingm/ABM>.
